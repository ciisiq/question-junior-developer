## <span style="background-color: #9DCBC1; color: black"> Technical exercises

The most of tech exercises I did was solving exercises like katas. Some examples:

![Alt question and people](images/wecan.png)

- Solve an anagram ( to make a function that shows it is a true or false anagram)
- To do a factorial of numbers (like they give number 5 and you need to give a result 5 _ 4 _ 3 _ 2 _ 1 = 120)
- Copy a home page on CSS and Html from the company you are doing the interview (make sure you looked at their page)
- Make a page like youtube using HTML and Javascript (like they give me a list of videos and I need to show this on the page and make this work to play and to go next video)
- You need to make a function using recursion, you have a number parameter and you need to return the sum of all even numbers by this number. (like 8 should be 20 [2, 4, 6, 8 = 20 ])<br><br>

## <span style="background-color: #9DCBC1; color: black"> Questions to ask after the interview:
